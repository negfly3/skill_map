## Category D — Product & Application Engineering (Supporting Track)

**Focus:** building and shipping usable systems

### Skills Included
- Modern Full Stack Development  
- Cloud Computing (applied use)  
- Blockchain (application-level)

### Typical Roles
- Full Stack Engineer  
- Platform Engineer  
- Product Engineer  

⚠️ **Important:**  
This category **cannot be your only track** if you are targeting deep technical or research roles.

➡️ **Continue here:** `skill-tracks/product-engineering.md`

## Decision Guide

- Care about **performance, scale, reliability** → Category A  
- Care about **learning systems and models** → Category B  
- Care about **theory, proofs, incentives** → Category C  
- Care about **shipping real products** → Category D  

---

## Rule of Progression

1. Choose **one primary category**
2. Master its core theory
3. Build **credible projects**
4. Add **one secondary category** only if needed

Breadth without depth will **hurt** your job prospects.

## What Comes Next

Each category contains:
- Core expectations
- Skill-specific projects
- Resume positioning
- Interview patterns
- Where these jobs actually exist

Proceed only after choosing your category.
